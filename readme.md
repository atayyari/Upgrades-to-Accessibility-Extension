# **CSCE 3444 Accessibility Extension**
This Chrome extension is designed to provide a suite of tools that allow a smoother and more accessible browsing experience to people who have disabilities surrounding their ability to read, view, and parse web content.

## **Tools:**
### **Dyslexia Font Changing**
This tool is designed to swap fonts displayed in a given webpage from their existing form to *Open Dyslexia*, a font that makes it easier for individuals with dyslexia to read text.

### **Webpage Color Swapping**
The webpage color swap feature is built to invert a webpage's background color and text color's. Swapping to light text on a dark background has been shown to help visibility for some, while reducing eye strain.

### **Text-to-Speech Reading**
The text-to-speech feature will allow HTML text to be read directly to the user through text-to-speech synthesization.

### **Adjustable Font Spacing**
The font spacing feature allows users to adjust the amount of space between displayed characters and words.

### **HTML Element Highlighting**
The element highlighting feature allows for each HTML element to be separately "highlighted" with a background color that is different from that of the webpage, making elements easier to distinguish from one another.
